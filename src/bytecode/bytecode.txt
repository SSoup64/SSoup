The virtual machine that SSoup will run on is a stack based virtual machine.

Bytecodes:
NOP					- Placeholder instruction.
PUSH_INT $x			- Pushes the integer x onto the stack.
PUSH_FLOAT $x		- Pushes the float x onto the stack.
PUSH_STRING $x		- Pushes the string x onto the stack.

I_PUSH_GLOBAL $x 	- Pushes the value of the global variable with address $x
I_PUSH_LOCAL $x 	- Pushes the value of the local variable with address $x

I_POP_GLOBAL $x 	- Pops the top value of the stack and puts it in the global variable with address $x
I_POP_LOCAL $x 		- Pops the top value of the stack and puts it in the local variable with address $x

OP_PLUS				- Pops the 2 top values on the stack, applies the + operators to them and pushes the result to the stack.
OP_STAR				- Pops the 2 top values on the stack, applies the * operators to them and pushes the result to the stack.
OP_MINUS			- Pops the 2 top values on the stack, applies the - operators to them and pushes the result to the stack.
OP_SLASH			- Pops the 2 top values on the stack, applies the / operators to them and pushes the result to the stack.

EXIT				- Makes the program quit.

DEBUG_PRINT			- Pops the top value on the stack and prints it to the console.

JMP $x				- Jumps to the address x.
JMPF &x				- Jumps to the address x as and act as if the jump is to a function.

NPL					- Create a new parameter list.
PL_APPEND			- Appends the top value on the stack to the parameter list.

RETURN				- Ends the function call.

More instructions will be added in the future.
